# Benchmark Testing 

This repository contains benchmark tests for 3 different test workflows `WordCount`,`IsPrime` and `AstroPhysics`. 
Within the folder is the python file which was used for each test along with the commands used to run the workflow normally and 
with the serverless framework. `output.md` shows the results from running each command specified in the test file. Assuming you have 
followed the installation guide and are running all 3 elements of the application (server,execution,redis-server),
you should be able to run the python files with the normal `python` command.
